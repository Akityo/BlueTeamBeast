# Preparation
The scripts in this section will help, deploy endpoint logging and monitoring solutions, and create a baseline of hosts on the network.

It is recommended that you first run Get-PSVersion.ps1. This is because some of the scripts function differently depending on if the hosts are running PowerShell v2 or v3+. Version 2 is less featured and required a different approach that in some cases requires extra steps on your part to deploy the agents.

You should carefully follow each scripts instructions in order to have quick and effective deployment.
