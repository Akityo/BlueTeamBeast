# Detect injected threads and stop them on remote hosts

You will require Get-InjectedThread.ps1 and Stop-Thread.ps1 to be in the same folder.
Download these in the zip from <a href="https://gist.github.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2</a> and place them in the same directory.

Technically the Stop thread scripts should come under "Eradication" but for now they will sit together with Get-InjectedThread.

Credit to Jared for creating those scripts, helping us all.
